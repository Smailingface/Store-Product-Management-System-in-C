# Store-Product-Management-System-in-C
A simple C program to manage store inventory. It allows adding, searching, displaying, and purchasing products using structures and dynamic memory. The system is designed for basic store management. This is my first C project, and it has been a great way to deepen my understanding of the language.

This project has been an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of the C programming language, learning more about memory management, the use of structures, and pointer handling. Throughout the development of this inventory management program, I was able to apply many concepts I had learned, but never in such a structured way.

Working with functions like malloc and free helped me gain a better understanding of dynamic memory management, which is crucial for writing efficient programs that can handle large amounts of data without exhausting system resources. Additionally, this project helped me clarify fundamental concepts such as arrays, variables, and memory management.

I also learned how to use return in various ways: from returning specific values like integers or structures to using it in functions that simply perform actions. This helped me better understand how to manage program flow and how to make functions return useful information for other parts of the code.

This project has solidified my basic knowledge of the C language, which provides me with a strong foundation to learn new programming languages more dynamically.
